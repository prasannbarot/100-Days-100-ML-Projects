# 100 Days, 100 Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of **100 end-to-end machine learning projects**, one per day.  
Each project demonstrates **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **modeling**, and **explainability** using real-world datasets.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build a strong ML portfolio with practical projects.  
- Demonstrate applied skills across different domains.  
- Share daily learnings with the community.  

---

## Each project markdown file includes:
- Dataset details  
- EDA summary  
- Modeling approach  
- Key insights & results
