2026-01-29,"Daily Discussion Thread for January 29, 2026","RIGHT BACK TO GEX STABLE.

Literally everytrading day is an email that says ""aight boys here is excise risk"". 

Bers will scream ""but the data the future"".

I am not going to sit here and tell you if this is good, bad, makes sense or not. I have no fucking idea what the future holds.

But the order book always determines the spot price and now:

1. Order book is dominated by option chain
2. Option chain has a point where it is GEX stable
3. The GEX stable point is what will be excised
4. The closing price wil be GEX stable for excise

nothing else matters. If you trade options your singular focus should be working out where GEX stable is.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qq6pen/daily_discussion_thread_for_january_29_2026/

Not in our day to day lives, but in the progress of the superpower as a whole. When the top has all the money, the #1 priority becomes risk aversion. We have the most action oriented guy running things in years and the best we getting is a chair flip in latin america lol. No new territory with the strongest military. No consoladation from canada. Just more power to law enforcement and additional trading fees so defense contractors can sell some equipment to deter nukes over greenland. Meanwhile china builds another bridge in record time, japan slashes tax on food, and russia figures out how to be self sufficiant. Weve got about 10 more years of this before we fall too far behind to catch back up. But no risk = no reward, and the rich hate risk so here we are.

2026-01-16,"Daily Discussion Thread for January 16, 2026","This is a tl;dr poast. Yes, I'll put the fries in the bag as well. Yes, ketchup too.


Reviewing my regarded trades over the past \~8 years: (personal experience. everyone's a different trader. just my own results). if you're new to trading take it with a grain of salt; there are 1000s of factors that will affect results.


The LEAST profitable were short sales of round lots of stock. The second least profitable were short sales that were DCA'ed into; again individual stock. The third least profitable were PUT options that were purchased. (I have not done debit spreads. ever). Fourth least were PUT credit spreads. Fifth least profitable were CALL credit spreads
.

Any option fancy spreads 3+ contracts were slightly unprofitable. All of them iron condor, assgape one-eyed regard condor butterly up your ass spread, condor duk peanut butter etc. NOTE: I managed these trades intensely. otherwise they would rank # 1 worst. ----------------------profitable. I have never bought calls, so no experience with that. Fourth most profitable were call credit spreads. Third most profitable were short sales of round lots of spy, qqq and iwm. Second most profitable were naked calls. First most profitable were naked puts.


conclusion: you wasted 17 minutes of time. yes, a regard like you will need that long to read the above. i fuked ur mom last night.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qee510/daily_discussion_thread_for_january_16_2026/

Has made major partner announcements including NVDIA and Open Ai, and the transformation from RPA into agentic with Maestro is starting to be an absolute instead of just a “what if”.

PATH is the real deal. I have 15 long dated calls. I love this company.

2026-01-29,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, January 30, 2026","#I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. Kevin currently serves as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution, and Lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is a Partner of Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office LLC. Kevin received his A.B. from Stanford University, and J.D. from Harvard Law School. He has conducted extensive research in the field of Economics and Finance. Kevin issued an Independent Report to the Bank of England proposing reforms in the conduct of Monetary Policy in the United Kingdom. Parliament adopted the Report's recommendations. Kevin Warsh became the youngest Fed Governor, ever, at 35, and served as a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 until 2011, as the Federal Reserve's Representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20), and as the Board's Emissary to the Emerging and Advanced Economies in Asia. In addition, he was Administrative Governor, managing and overseeing the Board's operations, personnel, and financial performance. Prior to his appointment to the Board, from 2002 until 2006, Kevin served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and Executive Secretary of the White House National Economic Council. Previously, Kevin was a member of the Mergers & Acquisitions Department at Morgan Stanley & Co., in New York, serving as Vice President and Executive Director. I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin! PRESIDENT DONALD J.

My last guy on a conventional loan was always back to me within an hour or two whenever I needed anything.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qja0w8/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_22_2026/

2026-01-21,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, January 22, 2026","Raymond James Upgrades $GOOG to Strong Buy from Outperform, Raises PT to $400 from $315

Analyst comments: While we were constructive on checks/DOJ potential last year, our updated bottom-up analysis of GCP (GPU, TPU, PaaS) and Search (Core, AIO, AIM, Gemini) leads to a material upward revision in 2026/27 estimates with RJ sitting at the Street high for 2027 revenue, prompting an upgrade from Outperform to Strong Buy.

We believe GOOG is likely entering a cycle of improving AI Stack narrative and upward revisions that could create one of the highest quality top-line AI acceleration stories in the public universe.

Our baseline assumption for 2026 is that the AI Stack narrative and fundamental revisions will be the primary mega-cap Internet performance drivers as opposed to the mean reversion trade (i.e., buying depressed/ selling elevated multiples).",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qja0w8/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_22_2026/

2026-01-18,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, January 19, 2026","The letter from 🥭 to the PM of Norway:

“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT”

2026-01-15,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, January 16, 2026","second part of my hycroft call

The imminent end-game roadmap for Hycroft $HYMC is near and almost fully de-risked. What Eric Sprott's 4M share warrant exercise + 200,000 open market buy signifies (my guess):Key 1) Eric hates CAPEX. 2) He's seen the cores/drill visuals → He knows a high-grade starter mine is 100% viable. There won't be a $1.5bn dilution round to build a POX or roasting facility.Once the underground starter mine is built, Nevada Gold Mines (Barrick) is down the road. Their roasters/facilities are stuck with low-grade ore; they're in dire need of high-grade ore. These facilities are expensive to run and not being at full grade is costly.

Hycroft enters a tolling agreement with Barrick and starts delivering high-grade ore, earning several hundred million a year. The now de-risked project + cash flow positive + critical mineral resource means financing is easier/less [dilutive.At](http://dilutive.At) some point, Barrick will be forced to bid to keep their roasters fed. Eric Sprott, now over 40% shareholder, is the gatekeeper—he will hold out for a premium offer as he said. A debt-free and cash flow positive Hycroft can hold out indefinitely / go alone if need be.A premium takeover is the end game. 

All this will be confirmed once the upcoming MRE (maybe Tuesday after MLK) puts into writing that the high grade is there and justifies an underground starter mine.If you look at Diane's recent interviews across Crux Investor and Catt Calls, the roadmap is already laid out and discussed in detail. The only missing piece is the PDF report for the public.Eric's warrant exercise + open market buying is a 4 standard deviation conviction move. To him and his position, this PDF is all but de-risked, the high-grade starter mine is all but confirmed—no CAPEX/dilution wall coming.

The market is just waiting for a PDF press release—a very high asymmetrical bet for insiders vs. public. Hycroft re-rates and awaits a premium takeover bid by end 2026.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qdvkpy/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_16_2026/

How important is a Pre Purchase Inspection?

For a used vehicle? 2023 BMW M240I. Vehicle only has 20k miles and Im purchasing from the dealer. They are giving me 4 new all winters, and already replaced the rear brake pads. It is not a CPO title, but dealer said it really doesn't need anything else, and for $800 they can CPO the vehicle for me as well. I'm currently leaning towards just letting them safety it. How can I confirm they actually put new rear brake pads on? I know, sounds bizarre. Blame the trust issues on my ex gf. 

Would you still take this to a mechanic and let them hoist it? Car is so new, that I dont think it will need anything, carfax is also clean with 1 previous owner.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1qk6jn0/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_23_2026/

2026-01-05,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, January 06, 2026","Maybe I’m just a cynic but I’ve just thought about my losses in an even darker way. The 90k I made and lost in a matter of days is nearly 1% of $10M, let’s just call that a great FIRE number and it’s more than most people make in their lives (probably top 10% lifetime earnings). Let’s say the average person makes $2-3M in their lifetime, that means 90k is 3-4.5% of that which is a very very large portion when you think of it over a lifetime. Plus that’s 9% of a million, certainly a substantial portion. Sure with my career path and ambition I know I can do way better than the average person at 25, but even then that’s still nearly 0.1% of $100M which isn’t exactly a small percentage as that’s nearly 1 in 1000. Spread that across an entire lifetime and that’s a pretty significant portion. If you lose that everyday, 1,000 days is only a bit under 3 years so honestly not that long. I could very easily make 1,000 purchases manually. Not hard to buy a Lambo everyday and need a new Lambo the next day because you broke it. Sure if you’re Jeff Bezos 90k is nothing, but even if you’re my physician parents who now have $50M in their 60s, 90k is still nearly 1/500 of everything they’ve built over a lifetime. I can count to 500 in minutes, so it’s actually a pretty significant portion, so I’ve lost a non insignificant portion of everything they’ve worked for in their entire lives. Plus I lost a very very substantial portion of what the average person makes in their entire lives (3-4.5%). Maybe I’m just on a bunch of drugs right now and I’m panicking for the wrong reason, but this is no longer within the realm of casual loss porn.",-8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q4xuld/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_06_2026/

2026-01-05,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, January 06, 2026","I have these mini cycles I follow with different stock. Until they mature out of the range that is.

I started this with pltr when it was bouncing between 15 and 30. Id buy in the teens, and sell in the 30s. I was personally able to capture this trade 2 times. If I had held, obviously id be better off. But frankly I only have a few years of experience trading at this level, so I am still getting the hang of it.

Then I did sofi,  from single digits to 20+ did this twice. Obviously love sofi still, but it is ""maturing"" and im not sure I'll see another single digit entry without a catastrophy.

Ive run this on SERV twice. Thankfully, due to the most recent pullback, was able to grab SERV at 9 bucks again, with plans to sell that between 15 to 18. This may be the last cycle for them, maybe not, but I know they can move that range quickly when things line up so im riding that train right now.

I have run ONDS from 4 to 11, then most recently bought back in at 5 and running it till 15 now. Sold half yesterday for TP, but I had a huge position and we are in price discovery, so I let half ride.

All of these stocks have 1 thing in common,  WSB is polarized on them, and they are heavily discussed. If WSB is all in or all out, I dont touch it.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1q4xuld/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_06_2026/
